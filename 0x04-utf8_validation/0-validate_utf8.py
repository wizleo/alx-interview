# HINT:
# A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the
# following rules:
#
# For 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its unicode code.
# For n-bytes character, the first n-bits are all one's, the n+1 bit is 0,
# followed by n-1 bytes with most significant 2 bits being 10.
# This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:
#
#   Char. number range  |        UTF-8 octet sequence
#       (hexadecimal)    |              (binary)
#   --------------------+---------------------------------------------
#   0000 0000-0000 007F | 0xxxxxxx
#   0000 0080-0000 07FF | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
#   0000 0800-0000 FFFF | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
#   0001 0000-0010 FFFF | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
# Given an array of integers representing the data, return whether it is a
# valid utf-8 encoding.
#
# Note:
# The input is an array of integers.
# Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data.
# This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.

    - The data will be represented by a list of integers, where each integer
